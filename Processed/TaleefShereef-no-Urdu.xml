</p><p>Having finished the translation, I became convinced, that I should not have fulfilled the whole of my duty if I did not make it public; and ill calculated as I know myself for such an undertaking, I have ventured to offer it to the world, with all its imperfections.
</p><p>Conscious, that the liberal minded will give me credit for the best of motives, I shall not dread criticism; and if it has the effect of inducing those more competent to the task to an inquiry into the properties of native medicines, my views will have been fully accomplished.
</p><p>In writing the names of the different medicines, I have followed the Author&#8217;s example, and have been guided solely by the pronunciation, without altering the sound given to the letters in English, and have not borrowed a single name from any work of Oriental literature. In this I may have acted wrong, but I did so from the conviction, that by this method, the names would be more familiar, and better understood, by the Natives in researches after the different drugs.
<pb n="iv"/></p><p>I have inserted as many of the systematic names as I could trace, both from Dr. Fleming&#8217;s work, and those of others; but I regret, that I was not honored in the acquaintance of any Botanist who could have assisted me with more.
</p><p>To the youth of the profession, I trust the work may be acceptable, by leading them to the knowledge, that such medicines are in existence; and my medical brethren of the higher grades may not deem further inquiry into the properties of native drugs beneath their notice.
</p><p>To the profession at large, then, I beg leave to dedicate this Translation, with the hope, that they will make due allowance for all faults, and that some of the more experienced will favor us with another and better edition.
</p><p>To my respected friends Messrs. Wilson and Twining, the profession is indebted, that this little work ever saw light; and though they are godfathers to none of its errors, yet without their encouragement and aid, it must have slumbered in oblivion, and remained as was intended, (after the failure of an attempt on the part of the translator,) a manual for his own private use.

THE ORIGINAL, WITH ADDITIONS.</head><head>ALEF</head><p id="p1"><ab type="parNum">1</ab> <hi rend="sc">Am, Ambe, Anbe</hi>.&#8212;The Fruit, <hi>Mangifera Indica</hi>.
</p><p>The produce of a large tree very common in Hindostan. The fruit is about the size of, and very much resembling in shape, a goat&#8217;s kidney, and having the external appearance of an apple. When ripe, it sometimes retains the green color, but oftener becomes yellow, or red and yellow.
</p><p>The virtues ascribed to this tree, are as follows:&#8212;The bruised leaves and young shoots applied to the hair, expedite its growth, and considerably darken its color.
</p><p>The bark of the trunk of the tree, and of its roots, is cooling and astringent; the former powerfully so. The leaves are astringent, and promote digestion; their ashes styptic.
</p><p>The young flowers are cool and drying; have a pleasant aromatic scent, and when taken internally, are cooling and astringent; recommended for the cure of chronic Gonorrh&#339;a or Gleet, purulent expectoration, bilious foulness of the blood and boils. The young unripe fruit has much acidity, and is drying; moderately used, it increases all the animal secretions, and is beneficial in chronic affections of the liver; it promotes appetite, and is lithonthriptic. The fruit, when ripe, is sweet, cooling, <corr sic="and " resp="errata"/>mucilaginous and heavy, tending to allay thirst, and useful in nervous affections; strengthens the system, restores impaired appetite, (is said to moderate an increased secretion of bile,) and improves the complexion. The fruit is of various sizes, from a few drachms to a <pb id="pb2" n="2"/>pound weight; but it is usually met with weighing about 4 ounces. It becomes acid about a month after the fall of the flower, in which state it is used as preserves, such as jellies, pickles, &amp;c.; at this time, too, it is used as seasoning for <hi>Pilaus</hi>, and other dishes; for when the stone or kernel has become hard, it is no longer fit for these purposes. When the fruit has attained its full growth, and when nearly ripe, it is to be taken from the tree, and put into dry grass, straw, or the leaves of the Palass tree, and there allowed to become ripe; this process deprives it of all acidity, and also prevents the formation of a resinous gum, which it contracts when allowed to ripen on the tree, and which renders it too pungent to be eaten with relish.
</p><p>The fruit is in perfection in the hot winds, and when the rains commence, it ripens very fast; before the cold weather it is usually out of season.
</p><p>There are some trees that blossom the whole year, and some few that even produce fruit; but instances of this are very rare.
</p><p>There is a variety of this tree on which the fruit is sweet from its first formation; this requires to be used early, otherwise it will in all probability become a prey to insects.
</p><p>Some trees produce fruit only once in 4 years. In general, it produces fruit in abundance every second year, and less in the alternate year; some are even perfectly barren every alternate year.
</p><p>There is a mode of manuring this tree, which it is said improves the flavour of the fruit greatly; this is mixing the juice of its fruit with milk, and pouring it over the roots. It is also said to be possible to communicate the flavor of any particular fruit to the mangoe, by its expressed juice being made use of, as an application to the roots of the tree.
</p><p>The kernel of the mangoe, roasted, is pleasant to the taste, and grateful to the stomach; it is much recommended in laxities of the bowels, and strengthens the <hi>prim&#230; vi&#230;</hi>; water drank after having eat of this kernel, seems to possess a flavor peculiarly excellent. The usual mode of preparing them, is to allow them to remain exposed to the rains, till the shell shall have become decayed; by this process it is deprived of any heating or irritating property. <corr sic="Perpared">Prepared</corr> in this manner, and kept a short time in lime juice, taken out, <pb id="pb3" n="3"/>bruised and mixed with salt, fennel, &amp;c, it is much extolled for strengthening the stomach, and promoting digestion.
</p><p>If preserved for 3 years, pounded, and swallowed to the quantity of a tolah, with a little water, no medicine is preferable for strengthening bowels habitually lax.
</p><p>In the acid state, the fruit is very prejudicial to those who have any disorders in their teeth, a cough, an affection of the chest, or who are subject to cholicky pain in the bowels, but very beneficial when used in irritable habits. The best method of using them is this. The acid unripe fruit, after the outer rind has been <corr sic="pealed" resp="errata">peeled</corr> off, is to be cut into thin slices, and infused for some hours in water; this water so impregnated, is to be drained off, mixed with a sufficient proportion of sugar, and used as sherbet. It produces a great relish for food, and is in other respects beneficial. The same effects are produced by the unripe fruit, being roasted and allowed to remain in water, as above mentioned. It is recommended in paralysis, from <hi>coup de vent</hi>. Many physicians have considered the mangoe to be of a cooling nature, but, in my opinion, it is heating in all its stages. The Yunani physicians have stated the ripe fruit to be hot in the 2d, and dry in the 3d degree.
</p><p>Its virtues may be described in a few words. It strengthens the system, gives tone to the <sic corr="kidneys">kidnies</sic><corr sic=" and stone" resp="errata"/>, restores impaired appetite, &amp;c. It is aperient, improves the complexion, beneficial in piles, an useful deobstruent, braces and increases the bulk of the solids, and removes nervous affections. In some of these disorders I am inclined to doubt of its good effects, but such virtues are attributed to it. It is recommended, in order to prevent any bad effects from the fruit in its unripe state, that raisins be <corr sic="eat">eaten</corr> with it. Hukeem Alwee Khan, a man of eminence in his profession in the reign of Mahommed Shah, says, that if ever this fruit disagreed with the system, it must have been eaten when unripe or green.
</p><p>I had occasion to attend a gentleman of very high rank, who laboured under dropsy; I cured him of the disease, but 3 years afterwards, having <corr sic="eat">eaten</corr> a large quantity of mangoes, the disease returned, and I have observed the same effects in other cases.
</p><p>Hukeem Alli Mughphoor, physician, states, that influenced by the resemblance of the mangoe to the human kidney, he concluded <pb id="pb4" n="4"/>that it must be beneficial in that organ, (disorders of;) he therefore prescribed it in a case of hectic fever, arising from diseased kidney, and completely cured the disease. In this I differ from him entirely; he must have mistaken the nature of the complaint, for a remedy given expressly for the cure of a disease in the kidney, could <hi>not</hi>, at the same time, have removed the fever, excepting appropriate medicines had been administered along with it!!
</p><p>The best mangoes are those having a thin juice, sweet and free from fibres; and they ought to be cooled in water or in ice, especially during the hot weather. It is preferable to use the juice of the fruit without eating any of the fibrous parts; a neglect of this may produce various disorders, such as indigestion, cholicky pains, &amp;c. It is very common to eat the expressed juice, mixed with sugar and other things, with rice, or with bread, but this is great imprudence; for in the most healthy subjects it may produce nausea, and general uneasiness.
</p><p>Should any ill effects follow the use of the mangoe, milk, or the kernel of the fruit, will be found a corrector. My father&#8217;s opinion is, that these are not the only remedies; for if it produces any heating effect, curdled milk will give relief, or even cold water, or acidulated sherbet, and he himself was always in the habit of using the <hi>Phalsa</hi> sherbet on these occasions.
</p><p>Should cholic be produced, the Oil of Almonds or other sweet oils, will remove the complaint; and a diarrh&#339;a is to be cured by the use of the kernel; and a swelling of the abdomen, by milk, in which a little ginger has been mixed; or even ginger by itself will have the effect
</p><p>A substitute for mangoe, as a medicine, may be had in Chobe Cheenee.
</p><p>In general, it will be adviseable to abstain from the use of the mangoe, till 2 or 3 showers of rain have fallen; but those of a cold phlegmatic or melancholic temperament do not require to be so particular.
</p><p>Those for whose complaints mangoes have been recommended, have in a few months derived great benefit from their use, by eating them with camel&#8217;s milk. There are many kinds of this fruit, and their names are as various; but the stronger the scent, the <pb id="pb5" n="5"/>more effectual they are as a medicine. In Persian it is called <hi>Nugzuck</hi>.
</p><p id="p2"><ab type="parNum">2</ab> <hi rend="sc">Aramsheetul</hi>.&#8212;Pungent and cooling; useful in bilious and catarrhal complaints; also recommended in foulness of the blood.
</p><p id="p3"><ab type="parNum">3</ab> <hi rend="sc">Akaholie</hi>.&#8212;Vermifuge, also recommended in bilious and catarrhal disorders, in seminal weakness and gonorrh&#339;a.

The fruit round, like a plum. The tree like that of the tamarind, of a pleasant acid, and sweetish astringent taste. It is aperient, cooling, and drying; of great use in eruptions of the skin, arising from a redundance of bile. Other virtues ascribed to this fruit may be found in all Yunani works. It is also called <hi>Bidjee</hi> and <hi>Dhatri Phill</hi>, used by the natives for cleansing the hair.
</p><p id="p6"><ab type="parNum">6</ab> <hi rend="sc">Aru</hi>.&#8212;A variety of plum, much resembling the common sort, both in the tree and fruit; it however possesses more acidity, and is less easy of digestion.

</p><p id="p8"><ab type="parNum">8</ab> <hi rend="sc">Aak</hi>.&#8212;<hi>Arug</hi>, <hi>Mudar</hi>, <hi>Asclepias gigantea</hi>. A milky shrub, very common all over India; its pod resembles a mangoe, but rather longer in proportion: when ripe it breaks, and is found filled with a white substance, resembling silk, to which the seeds are fixed. The leaves of the plant resemble the <hi>Dak</hi>, but are somewhat smaller: its height is generally from 1 to 1&#189; yard; when its leaves or stalk are broken, a white milky liquid exudes. There are two kinds, white and red; both are purgatives, violently so. It is said to be beneficial in the following disorders. Foulness of the blood, bilious affections, Juzam, Psora, Z&#230;rbad, boils, cuticular eruptions, diseases of the liver, visceral obstructions, h&#230;morrhoids, <hi>all internal</hi> diseases, dropsy and worms.
</p><p>(&#8220;Many and wonderful virtues are ascribed to this plant; but I must refer those who have faith in charms to the original <hi>Taleef <pb id="pb6" n="6"/>Shereef</hi>, when their curiosity will be amply gratified.&#8221; Translator.)
</p><p>All the above virtues have been ascribed to this plant; my opinion is, that the application of the leaves is useful in swellings, promotes suppuration in indolent tumors, and cures eruptions on the skin. The milk blisters, and if applied to the eye, it produces swelling, itchiness, and loss of vision. The powder of the root, mixed with goat&#8217;s blood and fresh butter, and applied to the eye, is said materially to strengthen vision. In other works it is said, that the milk of every variety of this plant is poisonous, and violently cathartic.

In the &#8220;<hi>Dhara Shakoi</hi>&#8221; it is called <hi>Mujeet</hi>, but I suspect that they are different plants, as the <hi>Mujeet</hi> is thin, and of a fine red color; whereas the <hi>Aal</hi> is blackish, with a tinge of yellow, though not thicker than the other.

The stem grows straight about a man&#8217;s height; the leaves are broad and triangular, the flower circular, flat and yellow, with serrated edges, and it is said to follow the sun in his diurnal progress. There are two kinds, a small and greater; their medical properties the same; they are bitter to the taste, and heating in a considerable degree. It is beneficial in cholicks, dropsical affections, foulness of stomach, and rheumatism; it also improves appetite, and promotes expectoration in cases of cold, accompanied by fever.
</p><p id="p11"><ab type="parNum">11</ab> <hi rend="sc">Area</hi>.&#8212;A culinary fruit resembling the cucumber, and grows in the rainy season; it is so cooling that it produces pains all over the body; it is moreover difficult of digestion, and if taken in any quantity produces fever.
</p><p id="p12"><ab type="parNum">12</ab> <hi rend="sc">Anwul (Nasal)</hi>.&#8212;A large tree very common in India, which when in flower, has a very beautiful appearance; its flowers are yellow, resembling those of the <hi>Cassia</hi>. There are two kinds of this, one called <hi>Mahedi Anwul</hi>. Of this also there are two varieties. It is cooling, and the medicinal properties of all varieties are the same. It is used with good effect in bilious vomitings, and also in <pb id="pb7" n="7"/>leprous affections of the skin. It is recommended in weakness of the eyes, asthma, affections of the chest, and foulness of blood. It strengthens the weak and emaciated, and braces the solids when relaxed by disease or otherwise.

Its leaves resemble those of the <hi>Sinobir</hi>, but are somewhat broader: it is an evergreen, and its wood is, when good and full-grown, dark-colored and durable; its leaves are smooth and glassy; its properties said to be very active and deleterious; it is heating in a considerable degree, and is said to be lithonthriptic. It dispels flatulency, and cures tympanites. It is recommended in chronic affections of the liver. Filings or raspings of the wood are styptic, and its charcoal more so; a decoction of the wood, in spirits, is very effectual in discussing scrophulous tumours, when externally applied.
</p><p>The raspings of the wood, mixed with whites of eggs, is an excellent application to scalds and burns; they are also famed for cleaning deep foul ulcers, and inducing the growth of healthy granulation.

The natives, however, have a prejudice against allowing it to grow beyond 3 or 4 years, and even this is only in solitary places. The chief reason I fancy is, that it interferes with the cultivation of the soil, if permitted to remain. They usually sow it with grain, and reap the grain crop before it has attained its full height; this they can do annually, but seed sown under its shelter the second year, would not succeed.

The seed is like the coffee bean, and is stained with different colored spots, so as to appear like marbled paper; the kernel is white, soft, and oleaginous. There are two kinds of this; one with a red, the other with a green pod; the former is culled <hi>Jongia Arnde</hi>; both varieties are sweet, heating, and heavy. The oil of the kernel is useful in removing obstinate constrictions of the intestines, when given warm; also in flatulency; rheumatic swellings of the joints and lumbago; in strangury, spasms in the urinary bladder, headaches, dropsy, and feverish complaints. It is also recommended as an expectorant in difficulty of breathing, and in cough; in affections of the skin, and in superabundance of mucus in the intestines. It is a warm, stimulating purgative; the dose one or two table spoonsful. Both my father, uncle, and I, have used it with great success, in cases of obstinate cholic from costiveness. They also used the leaves moistened with <hi>ghee</hi>, as an external application in rheumatic pains and swellings. If the seeds are bruised, and mixed with curdled milk, and allowed to remain in this state till <pb id="pb12" n="12"/>they become putrid, they form an excellent application for the cure of itch, and usually succeed in 7 or 8 days. It has also been said, that if one of the kernels be taken at first, and daily increased by one, till 100 are taken, and then decreased in the same gradual manner, it will cure Juzam, and other kinds of Leprosy.

The Author of the Book Tophut-ul-Momeneen, describes the tree as resembling the Pomegranate tree; but I suspect he had never seen it. It is acid and heavy, removes flatulence, but increases bile and blood.
</p><p>When ripe, it is laxative, promotes appetite, and is beneficial in oppression after meals. It is dry, light, cardiac, and restores prostration of strength from fatigue. It removes nausea, giddiness, thirst, and general heat. Sherbet prepared from it, should it agree <pb id="pb17" n="17"/>with the stomach, is preferable to any other, and prevents the noxious influence of the hot winds on the system. The kind which is red, ought to be chosen for preserves, and it possesses all the properties of the fresh fruit. The flowers of the tamarind eat with meat, increase its flavor; they also prevent accumulation of bile, are aperient, and increase appetite; but they are improper when acidity prevails in the stomach.

Its use is grateful to the system, and it gives strength to the intellectual powers, also tone to the stomach. It is injurious to the throat, to the solids, to respiration, and to the intestines; but its corrector is sugar, and if it be sliced, put in rose water to which sugar is added, and allowed to stand for some time, its beneficial properties are increased, while its injurious qualities are prevented or corrected. A preserve made from it, is excellent, and is used with stews and Pilau, as giving them great additional relish.

It is hot, gives strength to the eyesight, is useful in Juzam, and is vermifuge. A. <hi>Zeebuck</hi>. P. <hi>Seemab</hi>. It is very generally used throughout India, in many ways, both in its native and prepared state; but in the latter we ought to be very cautious, for it is seldom sufficiently killed, or removed from its native state, in which it is a dangerous drug. One grain or two grains, or even a little more, is taken for a dose, and in some cases with success. Cups are also made of it, from which milk is drank; they possess this virtue, that a greater quantity of milk may be taken in this way than in any other. It is said, that if a little Mercury be tied up in a cloth, and boiled in milk, that the milk will have an aphrodisiac property. Should any one have taken live Mercury, and the result be, that he is attacked with Juzam, or other leprous affection, let him take the whole of an Indigo plant, and cutting it in small pieces, let it be boiled in a large quantity of water; then straining it, drink a cupful of the water very frequently, till all is taken, and till then eat no food. All the Mercury will in the course of the day be evacuated per urethra, and if the whole does not make its escape the first day, the treatment must be repeated. If the urine be received into a brass vessel, or any other with a polished surface, the Mercury will be detected; many people having been in this predicament, have followed this advice, and found the result to be as I have stated it.
<pb id="pb27" n="27"/></p><p>In a state of calcination, if it is mixed with strong vinegar, or lime juice, and afterwards dried, if no live Mercury appears it is good; otherwise it is dangerous. Others have said, that if mixed and rubbed with the juice of the radish leaf, till they are incorporated, and then a little lime juice poured over it, and again rubbed and dried, it will be fit for use; and the less live Mercury that is perceptible, the less dangerous it is.
</p><p>To make cups and balls of Mercury, triturate the Mercury well with pounded bricks, in an iron pot, moistening the mixture with water; wash the whole in water, and strain through a moderately fine cloth, till the Mercury becomes perfectly clear like a looking glass. Take equal parts of this purified quicksilver, rock salt, and sulphate of copper, and put them into an iron pot, with strong vinegar or lime juice, and let the whole be well triturated for 7 or 8 hours, when the compound will appear like butter; wash this well in water, that the salt and sulphate be carried off, and the Mercury left behind; take this Mercury and coat over the outside of an unburnt earthen vessel or cup, till it shall be well covered and appear like Mercury; place this in a dish filled with lime juice, and let it remain for a week, then take it out and place it in the sun to dry and harden; when quite hard, it may be used in this way, or it may be filled with water and kept so, till the clay becomes soft enough to be separated from the quicksilver. Milk drank from this cup will have an aphrodisiac quality, and will increase appetite. For the formation of this cup, 9 or 10 tolahs of quicksilver will be requisite, and for the balls one tolah.
</p><p><hi>The Balls.</hi>&#8212;When the ingredients above-mentioned have, from long trituration, acquired the consistence of butter, balls may be formed of the composition in a fine cloth, and allowed to remain for 7 days in lime juice; then take them out and throw them into a boiling decoction of the Dhatura leaves, allowing it to be well boiled. The balls are then to be taken out of the cloth and preserved for use.

A preserve is made from the young shoots which is much esteemed, and is useful in promoting appetite and giving tone to the stomach, correcting an increased secretion of bile or phlegm. The young shoots are first cut into small pieces, and steeped in salt and water; then dried, and afterwards put into the vinegar or other acid, in which it is to be preserved.

</p><p>This is a medicine of foreigners, and it is said, that it has been in use for the last century; there is no account of it in any books of Hindoostan, or in the Yunani works; but in this part of the country it is in general use. I have partly taken the present description from the books of foreigners, and partly it is the result of my own experience. In foreign language, it is called Papita. It is a nut, round, more or less so, each weighing about a pice; it is depressed in the centre, and of a brown color, some darker than others. Its properties are said to be various. If one of the nuts be strung on a thread and retained about the person, it is a security against sorcery, and the attempted mischief will recoil on the sorcerer. Should any one be poisoned and this be administered, the poison will thereby be rendered innocent.
<pb id="pb30" n="30"/></p><p>Whoever shall keep this constantly about his person, nor noxious wind nor evil eye will affect him.
</p><p>If one retti or two retti weight of this be rubbed down in water and taken, it will cure pains in the stomach and cholicks.
</p><p>It is very beneficial in the disorder called Elaous, also in paralytic affections.
</p><p>In faintings and convulsions, if the teeth are forced open, and a little given internally, also the part of the forehead called <hi>peshanie</hi> scarified, and rubbed with a little of the medicine, the senses will be restored.
</p><p>In bites of snakes or the sting of any noxious reptile or insect, it is highly beneficial.
</p><p>The powder of the seed is styptic, and when applied over a wound in sufficient quantity to form a cake and bound up, it will stop any discharge of blood.
</p><p>In intermittent fever, if about 4 barley-corns in bulk be given before the cold fit, it will render it much less severe, or remove it altogether.
</p><p>In labor, if the pains are not sufficiently effectual, 4 barley-corns of this given, will expedite delivery; but if by mistake it be given after delivery, it will cause a protrusion of the bowels.
</p><p>In all laxities of the bowels it is useful. If a seed be allowed to remain in the mouth, it will promote the discharge of mucus which may oppress the chest, and will relieve acidity in the stomach.
</p><p>If the nut be cut into slices and fried in sweet oil, the oil will form an excellent application to chancres, venereal or other cuticular eruptions.
</p><p>Should any one have swallowed poison and become senseless, this oil forced into the throat, if swallowed, will save the patient.
</p><p>This oil will also have the effect of restoring sensation to parts deprived of it, if rubbed externally.
</p><p>In suppression of the menses, 7 or 8 barley-corns in bulk administered, will give relief.
</p><p>Should a tendon be cut through from a wound, filling the division with the powder, will promote adhesion.
<pb id="pb31" n="31"/></p><p>A tincture of it in spirits, in the strength of 25 nuts to half a pound of spirit, allowed to remain 15 days in the sun, is aphrodisiac, in the quantity of 16 liquid grains every night.
</p><p>I have found this medicine given to the quantity of half a drachm, more or less, mixed up into a bolus with rose-water, very beneficial in excessive vomiting.
</p><p>Once my father and I were proceeding on a journey, it happened, that some of our people had ate in the morning, of the food prepared the night before, which being stale, produced incessant and violent vomiting; their sufferings were great, and the color of their bodies completely changed. My father having no other medicine with him, except this, gave it to them mixed with rose-water, in various proportions, with great success.
</p><p>In unremitting vomiting, it ought to be given twice, when it will assuredly be successful.

It is a very common tree in India; it is bitter, astringent, and a little sweetish, hot, and moist; when ripe it is heavy, producing phlegm, bile, and wind, causing heat of stomach, and is difficult of digestion. It destroys appetite and induces costiveness; but unripe it is light, strengthens the circulation, and the whole body; induces costiveness; increases appetite, hastens digestion, and cures disorders of wind and phlegm. I have given it with other medicines for the cure of diarrh&#339;a with good effect. &#8220;And in dysentery, a table-spoonful of the pulp, made into sherbet, and taken several times a day, has been effectual.&#8221;

The <hi>Maadentezerrubad</hi> thus describes it: taar is a tree like the date tree; its leaves about a yard long; the kernel of the fruit is often sold for the sea cocoanut. The juice of this tree is the taarie, so well known; it is equally hot and cold, and moist in the 2nd degree. It is aphrodisiac and diuretic, induces corpulency, and if taken to excess produces intoxication and head-ache. If fresh drawn, it is sweet and less intoxicating; but allowed to remain for a night, it becomes acid, and then it is very inebriating. The fresh taarie improves the complexion, moistens the brain; is beneficial in hectic fever, in difficulty of breathing, in depression of the spirits, and is aperient. If allowed to remain long, it becomes sour, smells very strong; is heating, and causes vomiting and indigestion.
</p><p>In the Lyzuttoor rejal, it is thus mentioned: taarrie is an intoxicating produce of the taar tree, very common to the eastward. The tree resembles the date tree, but its leaves are different: when fresh, the taarie is hot and moist, induces corpulency; is aphrodisiac, diuretic, and when it has acquired a strong smell, is intoxicating, and in that state, it is very heating, and produces indigestion, with heaviness of the brain.

In the opinion of Hukeem Alli Gheelanee, it is hot and dry; its smoke from its heating quality confuses the ideas, and reduces the strength; from its discutient property, it weakens the brain, and depresses the spirits. Those who are of a cold, moist temperament, may derive benefit from its use, but those who are of equal temperament cannot use it with impunity. It is useful in piles the consequence of cold, also in waterbrash, and complaints of this nature; it promotes digestion and dissipates flatulent pains. It increases the strength of vision when it is weakened by the effects of cold, but adds to it when it has been caused by heat. In difficulty of breathing or <pb id="pb61" n="61"/>pain in the chest, proceeding from an accumulation of viscid phlegm, it is very useful. It is prejudicial in thin spare habits; it shuts all the passages, decreases the power of the absorbents, and consequently prevents the absorption of chyle, thereby weakening the system, and drying up and emaciating the body. It produces hectic fever in the aged, and many other disorders in which medicine is useless. Its corrector, according to the author of the Dara Shekoi, is milk; and he gives this wise reason for it, that cloth stained with the smoke of tabacco can only be cleaned with milk. It is used in many ways, chewed, snuffed, smoked, &amp;c. but is least prejudicial when smoked, after being mixed up with <hi>goor</hi> and preserves. I have by experience found it effectual in wind of the stomach, in pains produced by flatulence, and in the waterbrash; but have found it prejudicial to those labouring under depression of spirits, or who are subject to heartburns.

The skin soon re-assumed its wonted color, and the disease was perfectly cured. From the above circumstance, I am led to conclude, that the application is a very powerful one, and acts as a blister.

For this reason too, I am in the habit of seldom giving these remedies internally, but I usually confine my use of them to external application, and as aphrodisiacs, which I prescribe to a few friends, who may have derived no benefit from Yunani prescriptions.

In the opinion of the physicians of India, the Sembill is a powerful medicine as an aphrodisiac. If the juice of the root be made into sherbet with equal part of sugar, it will increase age by restoring the vital energy, increase understanding and semen; the larger and older the tree, and the thicker the root, the greater its strength as a medicine.

</p><p>Ascetics have said, that the perpendicular root of a large full grown Sembill tree, cut in pieces, dried and reduced to a powder is powerfully aphrodisiac, in the quantity of 4 direms daily. I have taken this powder to the quantity of one tolah with sugar, and have also prescribed it with advantage; it strengthens the stomach, and is gently laxative. If given with honey, I conceive that its virtues will be increased. The author of the celebrated work <hi>Ahmed Ben Shirazee</hi> has told the following story, which I shall relate as nearly as may be in his own words. &#8220;I was,&#8221; says he, &#8220;on a journey, when coming to a village in India, and being very thirsty, I met an old man from whom I requested water to drink; I observed that this old man had a peculiarly healthy appearance, and seemed plump and stout; he had a young woman <pb id="pb104" n="104"/>with him, whom he sent to his house for water, and who brought it me to drink. I then asked him whether that young girl was his daughter; he laughing answered that she was his wife, and that he had three others equally young. I was somewhat surprised at this, and asked him if this was not too many for him; he replied no! More and more astonished, I asked him if this was really the case; he avowed it to be so. I then questioned him how he came to be endowed with so much strength, and how old he was; he told me that his age was 110 years, and related the following facts: That when 50 years&#8217; old he had already become aged and feeble, and was so much decayed in constitution, that he seldom rose from his bed, and when he did so, was obliged to support himself on a crutch. That a fakeer passing that way observed his feeble state, and feeling compassion for his helpless situation, asked him what ailed him: he replied, nothing; but that old age had come upon him. The fakeer then gave him a medicine which he had taken ever since, with an injunction to abstain from all acids: this he had done, and that the effect was such as I saw. He likewise told me that he had a son nearly 80 years of age, who had also used the fakeer&#8217;s prescription, and who was much stouter and more healthy in every respect than he.
</p><p>&#8220;Astonished at this relation, I procured the receipt, and thus hand it down to posterity.
</p><p>&#8220;Take the white roots of a full grown, healthy Sembill tree, which is soft; cut them in pieces, dry them in the shade, and reduce them to a powder: sift it very fine, with equal parts of sugar, and over the fire, form it into an electuary: of this 5 direms are to be eaten daily, and no acid to be used.
</p><p>&#8220;To this the old man swore, and brought his son and introduced him to me to prove the truth of his story. The son corroborated the assertion of his father, and added that he had ate the remedy only two years, when he became as he then was; certain it is, he had not a grey hair in his head.&#8221;

If the plant be pulled out by the root before it flowers, and dried in the shade, and ate with wheat flour, cow&#8217;s ghee, and sugar, it will restore and preserve youth, and prevent the hair from becoming grey; and if pounded and often used in powder, it will be found peculiarly tonic. If its seed be ate with sugar, it will preserve health to the extreme of old age.
</p><p>An old man is said to have eaten a preparation of this for a year constantly: the strength of youth was restored to him, and he lived to the age of 205 years. The physicians of India declare this to be the basis of the <hi>Elixir Vit&#230;</hi>. If the plant is taken before it flowers, and is bruised and eaten with ghee and honey, both the strength and appearance of youth will be preserved. Indeed, the extent of its virtues is only known to the most scientific of physicians. If its flowers are eaten for 40 days, the same effect will be produced; and the root used without intermission for <pb id="pb155" n="155"/>a year, incalculable benefit will be the result. If the root and leaves be bruised and eaten for three days, with cow&#8217;s milk and honey, it will be found highly aphrodisiac. If one of the seeds be swallowed without water, the eye-sight will be preserved, and no affection of the eyes will take place for a year. If two are swallowed, the eye-sight will be preserved for two years, and <hi>so on</hi>. I used it myself in my infancy, or early days, and have preserved my sight in a wonderful manner. My uncle used the distilled water of this, in depression of the spirits, and as a cardiac, with great success: he sometimes distilled from equal parts of this and <hi>Gowjeban</hi>, at other times with other cardiac medicines. If half a masha of the oil of this be ate with <hi>Paan</hi> in the cold weather, it will produce a genial warmth over the body; it will also remove affections from cold, and be found aphrodisiac. The oil is thus procured:
</p><p>The plant is moistened with water, and then rubbed between the hands with any sweet-scented oil, but not too much; it is then to be extracted in the same manner as that of <hi>Agur</hi> is procured. If a chittack of the following oil be eaten daily for 40 days, and during this time abstaining from intercourse with woman, it will be found that the aphrodisiac power will have become so great, that it will seem wonderful. It is thus prepared:
</p><p>Take the leaves, root, and all parts of the plant; bruise them, sprinkling a little water over them; then squeeze out 20 seers of the juice, and add to it five seers of sweet oil; boil the whole till the juice shall have evaporated, and the residue is the oil. Some use the medicine in this manner. During the months of August and September, with cow&#8217;s ghee. In April and May, with honey. In June and July, with sugar. In February and March, with congee. In October and November, with cow&#8217;s milk; and in December and January, with sour milk. The author of the <hi>Dhara Shekoi</hi> has said that the root is to be bruised in a copper vessel, with a pestle of the Neeb tree, adding a little water, till it has become black; then taken up by dipping cotton into it, and preserved for use. In the ophthalmia, a little of the cotton moistened and applied to the eye, will remove the disease.

It is astringent and bitter; pungent and cool, (some say hot and dry;) some call its qualities in equilibrium; it is quick of digestion; useful in disorders of bile, wind, and mucus, and I have known it to be of use in Juzam and white leprosy. I have also exhibited it with success in eruptions and scabies. One man I knew, whose whole body was white from leprosy. I prescribed it to him for 40 days, and cured him. I took the kernel of the <pb id="pb171" n="171"/>seed, bruised and sifted it, and gave it in the quantity that might be contained in the palm of his hand, fasting, and prohibited him from using any other kind of food than bread or <hi>dhal</hi>, without salt or ghee.
</p><p>It is also said by <hi>Hukeem Ali</hi> to be excellent in curing obstinate old ulcers, as also fistula in ano, by the application of its leaves. It is given in many and various ways. Its leaves are given fresh, sometimes dried and pounded, sometimes its juice is given, often the juice of the leaf buds, and not unfrequently its bark. It is likewise given mixed with <hi>Noora</hi>. Its juice is used with <hi>Noora</hi> to cleanse foul ulcers, and to cure carbuncle, and this it effects in a very short time. The <hi>Noora</hi> is added to it in one-eighth of its quantity, and <hi>Hukeem Ali</hi> has declared it to be the best ingredient in ointment that he ever tried.
</p><p>I have often used the leaves heated as an application to swellings and boils; it in some cases resolved them, in others expedited suppuration, and in all was beneficial. I have added salt to the bruised leaves for the same purpose, and found that it added to its efficacy.
</p><p>A decoction of the leaves as a fumigation is excellent in discussing swellings, and with the addition of the leaves of the Sumhaloo, with additional good effect. A fumigation of less heating properties may be obtained by the leaves of the <hi>Anbassaleb</hi>, being substituted for the <hi>Sumhaloo</hi>. The water of this decoction is useful in cleansing foul ulcers, and removing pain from the joints.
</p><p>The <hi>Neeb</hi> in the opinion of Indian physicians is cool, and <hi>Hukeem Urzanee</hi> has described its qualities as equal. If the decoction is used as a wash for the hair, it will darken its color, and increase its growth; and if the juice of its young leaves in the quantity of five or six direms be taken for seven days, it will cure scabies, ring-worm, and all kinds of acne, and it will purify the blood. A decoction of the bark of its root will restore suppressed menses, and if taken with goor it will produce abortion: prepared in this manner it will cure the under-mentioned diseases.
<pb id="pb172" n="172"/></p><p>Take of the flower, seed, bark of the root, and leaves (called <hi>Punjuk</hi>), let them be infused for a night in two maunds of water, then bury it in the ground for a month, after which distil its water for use.

Its juice is vermifuge.
