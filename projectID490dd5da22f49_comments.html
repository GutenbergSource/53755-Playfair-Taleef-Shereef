<HTML><BODY>The Taleef shereef, or, Indian materia medica, translated from an Urdu manuscript used by Indian doctors, is a list of mainly plants with their medical effects.

<p>Proofreading will not be difficult, except for a few pages that have been digitized in a somewhat low resolution.

<p>In front of each number is a small superscript number. These are sometimes hard to read, but are in order, so can be reconstructed from following or previous numbers if needed. During formatting there is no need to format these as superscript.

<p>Each entry contains the name of the medicine in Latin and Arabic script. Since the Arabic is almost always the same, just replace it with [AR: name], where name is the Latin name written just before it in lowercase letters. (This will give me a kick-start when transcribing the names during PP (Just adding some diacritics, and changing a few variations).

<p>In other places where you see Arabic script, you may just say [ARABIC], or transcribe it to Latin script as [AR: transcription], if you know how. I will take care of the proper Arabic script in the HTML version during PP.

<p>Please remove the words "Digitized by Google" from the bottom of each page. Google will be credited for their work on this.</BODY></HTML>
